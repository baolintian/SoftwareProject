# GNG

The game's full name is 'GNG NOT GAME' and the work is based on Game theory. 

Initially the project is aimed at teaching people to understand the principle behind Game theory like P position and N position. But with the limitation of technology and time(I need more time to prepare my English test), It's just a simplified demo.

Luckily, you can also play it with computer.Though it looks like that the computer has its own intelligence, but in fact it's just do some `XOR` operation. With the layout of 5*11, you have only on way to win the computer. Try you best.

The game is based on `pygame module` which has a refresh frequency behind the game.

Use python3 rather than python2.

1. package dependency：run`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`  
2. run：python3 main.py
3. you can also change the refresh frequency in `main.py`
